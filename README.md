## General info
This website is a small project I worked on as I started learning web development. I decided to further improve it and upgrade it so I can use it as a place to showcase my photography. 
I did a lot of experimenting with different funcionalities and designs, so far the website is majorly
front-end oriented. My future plans include adding more back-end that can help me manage the uploaded content
as well as making it more user friendly and responsive. I have learned a lot about web design by making 
this as my first website and tried to bring my ideas to life by using many different sources and inspirations.
